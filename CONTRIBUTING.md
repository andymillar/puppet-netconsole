Checklist
=========

  * Commits:

    - Make commits of logical units.

    - Check for unnecessary whitespace with "git diff --check" before
      committing.

    - Commit using Unix line endings (check the settings around "crlf" in
      git-config(1)).

    - Do not check in commented out code or unneeded files.

    - The first line of the commit message should be a short
      description (50 characters is the soft limit, excluding ticket
      number(s)), and should skip the full stop.

    - If you have a GitHub issue number, associate the issue in the message.
      End the commit message with "Fixes #1234".

    - The body should provide a meaningful commit message, which:

      - uses the imperative, present tense: "change", not "changed" or
        "changes".

      - includes motivation for the change, and contrasts its
        implementation with the previous behavior.

    - Make sure that you have tests for the bug you are fixing, or
      feature you are adding.

    - Make sure the test suites passes after your commit:
      `bundle exec rake spec` 

    - When introducing a large change, make sure it is properly
      documented in the README.md
